# `tparts`

A static site generator script written in AWK.

Requires `awk`, `find` in a typical \*nix shell environment.


To build the [example project](https://andis-sprinkis.github.io/tparts/) from source files found in `./site` into the output directory `./dist`, run
```bash
./tparts ./site ./dist
```

Currently tested and confirmed to work correctly via GNU AWK.
