# `tparts`

A static site generator script written in AWK.

Requires `awk`, `find` in a typical \*nix shell environment.


To build the example project ([on github.io](https://andis-sprinkis.github.io/tparts/), [on gitlab.io](https://andis-sprinkis.gitlab.io/tparts)) from source files found in `./site` into the output directory `./dist`, run
```bash
./tparts ./site ./dist
```

**Currently tested and confirmed to work correctly via GNU AWK (`gawk`).**
